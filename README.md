# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple tic-tac-toe game. The coordinates for the grid cells are as follows:

(1, 1) (1, 2) (1, 3) <br />
(2, 1) (2, 2) (2, 3) <br />
(3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 3)

The game starts with an empty grid. Enter the coordinates where you would like the next X or O to be.
Program stops when either player wins or the game results in a draw.
